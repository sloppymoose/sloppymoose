Hello and thank you for registering on our website!

You indicated during your registration that you had run with us before and we want to make sure that you retain credit for all your previous runs.

In order to do that, all we need is for you to verify that we've found the correct record!

<% if @matching_legacy_users.one? %>
<%= render 'verify_single_match' %>
<% else %>
<%= render 'select_from_matches' %>
<% end %>

One your account is linked, we'll import your previous check-in history and you'll be good to go!
