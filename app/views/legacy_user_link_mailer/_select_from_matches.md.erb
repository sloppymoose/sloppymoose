We found several records that look like they might be you and we need you to verify the date of your last Sloppy Moose check-in:

| Name  | Last Check-In Date | |
|-------|--------------------|-|
<% @matching_legacy_users.each do |legacy_match| %>
<% last_check_in = legacy_match.check_ins.where(legacy:true).order(:created_at).last %>
| <%= legacy_match.name %> | <%= last_check_in ? last_check_in.created_at.strftime('%B %e, %Y') : '' %> | [This is me!](<%= linked_legacy_account_url(access_token: @access_token.token, id: legacy_match.id) %>) |
<% end %>

All you need to do is click on the "This is me!" link that is next to the record that best matches you and your Sloppy Moose history.
